# Chess
Pygame Chess is a fully playable chess game built using Python and Pygame. The goal of the project was to recreate the classic game with smooth piece movement, legal move validation, turn-based gameplay, and visually clean board rendering. It runs locally and lets you play chess against another human on the same device.
